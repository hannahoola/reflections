What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- it creates a folder .git, which tracks all the activities (changes) in the directory=>
it's possible to get logs of all the changes done and make commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
- it allows to commit at once only some changes that were made during a certain period of time and
logically separate dirrerent changes

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? 
How would branches help?
- when you want to localize your code in diff languages
- when you want to run experimental code
- branches would eliminate the need for switching back and forth from older to newer commits

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
- they allow me to track branches creation
- they allow to understand, which commits are reachable within each branch

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
pros of auto merging:
+ fast
+ no need to do the code review and think

cons of auto merging:
- as of now, git software is not that "smart" to be able to distinguish changes as "to leave" or "to discard" correctly
- some wrong and nonsensical commits might happen
