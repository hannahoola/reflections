What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- it creates a folder .git, which tracks all the activities (changes) in the directory=>
it's possible to get logs of all the changes done and make commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
- it allows to commit at once only some changes that were made during a certain period of time and
logically separate dirrerent changes
