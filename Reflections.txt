How did viewing the diff between two versions help to spot the bug?
- No need to scroll through the entire code (less tedious)
- Less time consuming
- More chances to find all the bugs and miss nothing

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
- you can look at your past work and see, if you used efficient methods to implement some features
- roll back some changes you've done (which resulted in worse code)
- trace the changes other people made (and address them in case there are any problems)

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros of manual commits:
- no overclogging of commit history with teeny-tiny commits
- possibility to make logical commits (once the code for one feature was finished)

Cons:
- unexpected shutdown of a PC (blackout, system problem) will end up with not saving changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- Because systems like Google Docs have their target audience, which does not consider files as parts
of ecosystems, but rather as separate and unconnected items => they don't need the features Git has

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
- with git log I can see, who and when made the changes
- with git diff I can see the exact changes that were made

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
- I could be sure that nothing will be lost even if changes that break smth, are introduced
- I could also quickly find out, where and what was happenning that thngs got out of control

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
- I want to organize my first project on GitHub
- I want to have version control of my Reflections file
