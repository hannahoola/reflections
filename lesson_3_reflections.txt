When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when I want to share my work with sb else
- I want to edit my work on different devices and then sync it
- want to let others edit my code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- because I may want not to update some code I have on Github (for ex., some changes from other
contributors, I'd rather run a code review first)
